# To-do app

This application lets users keep track of their to-do items. While some parts of the application work, some features are still missing. When running the to-do app, you will find some to-do items of the things that still need to be done.

You should be able to run this project by simply loading it into Visual Studio and clicking the "Run" button, or alternatively by running `dotnet run` in a terminal inside the project folder of the web project. If this does not work, let us know.

The biggest feature to add is that we want to be able to categorize to-do items. For example, we may want to group to-do items by work/private, or any other categories. For this categorization, there is no code at all yet. Most important is that we can set a category when we are creating a new item, and can then filter the to-do items so that only the ones from the selected category are shown.

We have also created a unit test project, that currently only contains a single test. You may find it helpful to add some tests here for the functionality that is yet to be created.

There are no trick questions in this assignment. If something is unclear, or you think we made a mistake, please e-mail us and we will try to sort it out.

Designing a nice user interface is not part of the assignment, so don't worry about making it pretty.
